//! This module provides utility fuctions to work with Hypixel's network level and network experience.
//!
//!
//! This module follows the java implementation of the Hypixel API.\
//! See [here](https://github.com/HypixelDev/PublicAPI/blob/master/hypixel-api-core/src/main/java/net/hypixel/api/util/ILeveling.java).
//!
//! From the formulas written in this implementation, it can be seen
//! that the relation between the network level and the network experience can be expressed as:
//! ```math
//! \frac{dy}{dx} = gx + b \;\;\;\;\; \text{and} \;\;\;\;\; y(1) = 0
//! ```
//! where:
//! - y = network xp
//! - x = network lvl
//! - g = [`GROWTH`]
//! - b = [`BASE`]
//!
//! More specific: the integer part of the network level corresponds to an amount of experience
//! that follows these equations. The fractional part of a network level corresponds to an amount of
//! experience that is is linearly interpolated between two experience amounts corresponding to nearest surrounding
//! integer network levels.
